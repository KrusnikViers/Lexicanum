===Etymology 1===
{{root|en|ine-pro|*ǵʰeh₁-|*wendʰ-}}
From {{inh-lite|en|enm|gon}}, {{m-lite|enm|goon}}, from {{inh|en|ang|gān|t=to go}}, from {{inh|en|gmw-pro|*gān}}, from {{inh|en|gem-pro|*gāną|t=to go}}, from {{der|en|ine-pro|*ǵʰeh₁-|t=to leave}}.

The inherited past tense form {{m-lite|en|yode}} (compare {{cog|ang|ēode}}) was replaced through [[suppletion]] in the 15th century by {{m-lite|en|went}}, from {{cog-lite|ang|wendan||to go, depart, wend}}.

=====Usage notes=====
* Along with {{m-lite|en|do}}, {{m-lite|en|make}}, and to a lesser extent other English verbs, ''go'' is often used as a substitute for a verb that was used previously or that is implied, in the same way a [[pronoun]] substitutes for a [[noun]]. For example:
*: ''Chris: Then he '''goes''' like this:'' (Chris then waves arms around, implying that the phrase means ''then he waves his arms'').
* Some speakers use {{m-lite|en|went}} for the past participle, especially in informal contexts, though this is considered [[Appendix:Glossary#nonstandard|nonstandard]] and is [[Appendix:Glossary#proscribed|proscribed]].
* Like other English verbs, the verb ''go'' once had an alternative present participle formed with the suffix ''[[-and]]'', i.e. ''[[goand]]''. ''[[goand|Goand]]'' is now [[obsolete]], having been replaced by ''[[going]]'', except in a few rural dialects in Scotland and Northern England, where it is considered [[archaic]]. Even in such dialects, it is never used to form the continuous tenses. These examples are from the [[Highlands]]:
*: {{ux-lite|inline=1|en|'''Goand''' [[snell]] [[athwart]] the [[houf]], hoo hent 'im be the [[swire|swyr]].|'''Going''' swiftly across the churchyard, she grabbed him by the neck.}}
*: {{ux-lite|inline=1|en|'''Goand''' oot of the [[holt]], she saw a woundor baist.|'''Going''' out of the woods, she saw a magical creature.}}
